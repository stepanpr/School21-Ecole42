# The default compiled in settings are fairly paranoid. This sample file

# Please see vsftpd.conf.5 for all compiled in defaults.

# READ THIS: This example file is NOT an exhaustive list of vsftpd options.
# Please read the vsftpd.conf.5 manual page to get a full idea of vsftpd's
# capabilities.

# Uncomment this to allow local users to log in.

#
# Uncomment this to enable any form of FTP write command.

# Default umask for local users is 077. You may wish to change this to 022,

#
# The target log file can be vsftpd_log_file or xferlog_file.
# This depends on setting xferlog_std_format parameter

#
# Make sure PORT transfer connections originate from port 20 (ftp-data).

# If you want, you can arrange for uploaded anonymous files to be owned by

# You may specify a file of disallowed anonymous e-mail addresses. Apparently
# useful for combatting certain DoS attacks.
#deny_email_enable=YES
# (default follows)
#banned_email_file=/etc/vsftpd/banned_emails
#
# You may specify an explicit list of local users to chroot() to their home
# directory. If chroot_local_user is YES, then this list becomes a list of
# users to NOT chroot().

#
# You may activate the "-R" option to the builtin ls. This is disabled by
# default to avoid remote users being able to cause excessive I/O on large
# sites. However, some broken FTP clients such as "ncftp" and "mirror" assume
# the presence of the "-R" option, so there is a strong case for enabling it.

#
# When "listen" directive is enabled, vsftpd runs in standalone mode and
# listens on IPv4 sockets. This directive cannot be used in conjunction
# with the listen_ipv6 directive.
listen=YES
#
# This directive enables listening on IPv6 sockets. To listen on IPv4 and IPv6
# sockets, you must run two copies of vsftpd with two configuration files.
# Make sure, that one of the listen options is commented !!

# script to init pem:
# sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/private
# sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem -out /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem

# We need to specify the location of our certificate
# and key files. We actually combined both pieces of
# information into a single file, so we will point
# both options to the same file:
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.crt
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key

# Next, we need enable the use of these files and
# disable anonymous users. We should also force the
# use of SSL for both data transfer and login
# routines. This will make the security mandatory:

ssl_enable=YES
allow_anon_ssl=NO
force_local_data_ssl=YES
force_local_logins_ssl=YES

# Next, we will restrict the type of connection to
# TLS, which is more secure than SSL. We will do this
# by explicitly allowing TLS and denying the use of SSL:
ssl_tlsv1=YES
ssl_sslv2=NO
ssl_sslv3=NO

# We'll add a few more configuration options before finishing:
require_ssl_reuse=NO
ssl_ciphers=HIGH
